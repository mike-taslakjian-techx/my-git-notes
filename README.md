## Git & GitHub Assignment: Create and Manage a Personal Notes Repository

Create a Git-tracked project to organize your personal learning notes using simple .txt files. Use real Git workflows: branches, commits, GitHub integration, and pull requests.

🧩 Task 

Create a Github account (firstname-lastname-techx) Create a new repo my-git-notes Add a file, write 3–5 bullet points about what you’ve learned about Git so far. Once your file is ready, use Git to add it to your project and send it to your GitHub repo's main branch (commit/push). Make a new branch called something like "github-intro" to keep your GitHub notes separate. In this file, write a few points about what GitHub is and how it's used. Use Git to track and upload this file to GitHub — but this time, upload it to your separate branch, not the main one. Go to your GitHub repository in your browser. Create a pull request, you can add a short title and description, submit it for review.

🗂️ On GitHub, your project will have: A main branch with your Git notes A separate branch with your GitHub notes A pull request showing the new file ready to be reviewed
