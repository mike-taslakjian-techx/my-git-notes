1. Git is a powerful version control software that allows us to track all changes over time.
2. You begin by using git by creating a new folder and typing "git init" using the terminal.
3. You use "git add" to add files that are ready to be committed and "git commit" to actually commit them.
4. It is also best practice to create a .gitignore file to include files that should not be tracked, a README file to make sure others know how our project works and a license file to let others know how to use use the file appropriately.
